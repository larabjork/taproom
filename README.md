# Tip Top Taproom
## Created by Lara Bjork on February 14 and 21, 2020
### Project Description

This project was completed as a two-week independent assignment for the React class at Epicodus, after curriculum focused on React Fundamentals and Managing State. The task description was as follows:

_Week 1: This will be a two-week project. Spend today building a tap room in React where a bar or kombucha store can track their kegs. Today's focus includes creating a component tree and documenting your work._

_Week 2: This week you'll continue working toward completing this React project, including adding React state to manage, display, and collect dynamic data._

### Specifications
The assignment provided the following specifications:
_* Before coding, spend time planning and drawing out your React app's component structure. Include an image of this component tree in your README. Make sure it reflects the need to manage state._
_* As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store)._
_* As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list. (Don't worry about authenticating employee user accounts yet.)_
_* As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake._
_* As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. (Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints)._
_* As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1._
_* As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them._
_* As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. Perhaps based on their price (greater or less than $5 per pint, perhaps) or the particular style of beer or kombucha._
_* As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers._

### Component Structure
This component structure diagram will be revised if any further changes are made.

### Project Setup instructions
If something doesn't display correctly or goes wrong somehow, please contact me at <lara.m.bjork@gmail.com> and I will do my best to troubleshoot for you.

As noted above, this project was bootstrapped from the Create React App; the following setup instructions came from the app's boilerplate README file.
#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

#### Learn More
